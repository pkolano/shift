Reliably transfer SOURCE to DEST, multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY, or
arbitrary SOURCE to DEST and/or SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY combinations
read from stdin.  By default, symbolic links to files on the command
line are followed, but symbolic links to directories are not (identical
to the default behavior of cp).
.PP 
Local paths are specified normally.  A path PATH on a remote host HOST
is specified using scp-style "HOST:PATH".  Note that transfers between
two remote hosts are not supported.

.PP 
shiftc is the client for Shift, which is a framework for
\fBS\fPelf-\fBH\fPealing \fBI\fPndependent \fBF\fPile \fBT\fPransfers.  Shift
includes the following features, among others:
.IP -
support for local, LAN, and WAN transfers
.IP -
drop-in replacement for both cp and scp (basic options only)
.IP -
tracking of individual file operations with on-demand status
.IP -
transfer stop and restart
.IP -
email notification of completion, errors, and warnings
.IP -
local and remote tar creation/extraction
.IP -
rsync-like synchronization based on modification times and checksums
.IP -
integrity verification of transfers with partial retransfer/resum to
rectify corruption
.IP -
throttling based on local and remote resource utilization
.IP -
automatic retrieval and release of files residing on DMF-managed file
systems
.IP -
automatic striping of files transferred to Lustre file systems
.IP -
fully self-contained besides perl core and ssh
.IP -
automatic detection and selection of higher performance transports and
hash utilities when available including bbcp, bbftp, gridftp, mcp,
msum, and rsync
.IP -

./"################################################################
.SH "TRANSFER INITIALIZATION"
./"################################################################
Transfers are initialized using syntax identical to cp/scp for
local/remote transfers, respectively.  The most commonly used options
during initialization are listed below.
.IP "\fB\-\-clients=NUM\fP"
Parallelize the transfer by using additional clients on each host.  If
the number given is one, no additional clients will be used.  A number
greater than one will fork additional processes on each host to more
fully utilize system resources and increase transfer performance.
.IP "\fB\-\-create\-tar\fP"
Create a tar file of all sources at the destination, which must be a
non-existing file name.  This option implies \fB\-\-recursive\fP and
\fB\-\-no\-offline\fP.  By default, multiple tar files are created at
500 GB boundaries.  The split size may be changed or splitting disabled
using the \fB\-\-split\-tar\fP option.  The \fB\-\-index\-tar\fP option
may be used to produce a table of contents file for each tar file
created.  Note that this option cannot be used with \fB\-\-sync\fP.
.IP "\fB\-L, \-\-dereference\fP"
Always follow symbolic links to both files and directories.  Note that
this can result in file and directory duplication at the destination as
all symbolic links will become real files and directories.
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-directory\fP"
Create any missing parent directories.  This option allows files to be
transferred to a directory hierarchy that may not already exist, similar
to the \fB\-d\fP option of the "install" command.
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude=REGEX\fP"
Do not transfer source files matching the given regular expression.
Note that regular expressions must be given in Perl syntax (see
perlre(1) for details) and should be quoted on the command line when
including characters normally expanded by the shell (e.g. "*").  Shell
wildcard behavior can be approximated by using ".*" in place of "*".
.IP "\fB\-\-extract\-tar\fP"
Extract all source tar files to the destination, which must be an
existing directory or non-existing directory name.  This option implies
\fB\-\-no\-offline\fP.  Note that only tar archives in the POSIX ustar
format are supported, but GNU extensions for large uids, gids, file
sizes, and file names are handled appropriately.  Also note that this
option cannot be used with \fB\-\-sync\fP.
.IP "\fB\-\-host\-file=FILE\fP"
Parallelize the transfer by using additional clients on the hosts
specified in the given file (one host name per line).  This option
implies a \fB\-\-hosts\fP value equal to the number of hosts in the file
plus any additional hosts from the \fB\-\-host\-list\fP option.  Less
hosts may be used by explicitly specifying a \fB\-\-hosts\fP value.
Note that the actual number of client hosts used will depend upon number
of hosts that have equivalent access to the source and/or destination
file systems.  Within PBS job scripts, this option can be set to the
$PBS_NODEFILE variable to use all nodes of the job.
.IP "\fB\-\-host\-list=LIST\fP"
Parallelize the transfer by using additional clients on the hosts
specified in the given comma-separated list.  This option implies a
\fB\-\-hosts\fP value equal to the number of hosts on the list plus any
additional hosts from the \fB\-\-host\-file\fP option.  Less hosts may
be used by explicitly specifying a \fB\-\-hosts\fP value.  Note that the
actual number of client hosts used will depend upon number of hosts that
have equivalent access to the source and/or destination file systems.
.IP "\fB\-\-hosts=NUM\fP"
Parallelize the transfer by using additional clients on at most the
given number of hosts.  If the number given is one, no additional
client hosts will be used.  A number greater than one enables automatic
transfer parallelization where additional clients may be invoked on
additional hosts to increase transfer performance.  Note that the actual
number of client hosts used will depend upon the number of hosts for
which Shift has file system information and the number of hosts that
have equivalent access to the source and/or destination file systems.
Client hosts will be accessed as the current user with hostbased
authentication or an existing ssh agent that contains an ssh identity
from a file matching ~/.ssh/id*.
.IP "\fB\-\-identity=FILE\fP"
Authenticate to remote systems using the given ssh identity file.
The corresponding public key must reside in the appropriate user's
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote host.  Note that only
identity files without passphrases are supported.  If a passphrase is
required, an ssh agent may be used instead, but with a loss of
reliability.  This option is not needed if the remote host accepts
hostbased authentication from client hosts.  
.IP "\fB\-I, \-\-ignore\-times\fP"
By default, the \fB\-\-sync\fP option skips the processing of files
that have the same size and modification time at the source and
destination.  This option specifies that files should always be
processed by checksum regardless of size and modification time.
.IP "\fB\-\-include=REGEX\fP"
Only transfer source files matching the given regular expression.
Note that regular expressions must be given in Perl syntax (see
perlre(1) for details) and should be quoted on the command line when
including characters normally expanded by the shell (e.g. "*").  Shell
wildcard behavior can be approximated by using ".*" in place of "*".
.IP "\fB\-\-index\-tar\fP"
Create a table of contents file for each tar file created with
\fB\-\-create\-tar\fP.  The table of contents will show each file in the
tar file along with permissions, user/group ownership, and size.  For a
tar file "file.tar", the table of contents will be named "file.tar.toc".
Unless the \fB\-\-no\-verify\fP option is used, a checksum file will
also be created named "file.tar.sum", which is suitable as input for
"msum --check-tree -c".  Note that when \fB\-\-split\-tar\fP is used,
multiple table of contents and checksum files may be created.  For each
split tar file "file.tar-i.tar", the table of contents will be named
"file.tar-i.tar.toc" and the checksum file will be named
"file.tar-i.tar.sum".
.IP "\fB\-\-newer=DATE\fP"
Only transfer source files whose modification time is newer (inclusive)
than the given date.  Any date string supported by the Perl
Date::Parse module can be specified.  Note that this option can be
combined with \fB\-\-older\fP to specify exact date ranges.
.IP "\fB\-P, \-\-no\-dereference\fP"
Never follow symbolic links to file or directories.  Note that this
can result in broken links at the destination as files and directories
referenced by symbolic links that were not explicitly transferred or
implicitly transferred using \fB\-\-recursive\fP may not exist on the
target.
.IP "\fB\-T, \-\-no\-target\-directory\fP"
Do not treat the destination specially when it is a directory or a
symbolic link to a directory.  This option can be used with recursive
transfers to copy a directory's contents into an existing directory 
instead of into a new subdirectory beneath it as is done by default.
.IP "\fB\-\-older=DATE\fP"
Only transfer source files whose modification time is older than the
given date.  Any date string supported by the Perl Date::Parse module
can be specified.  Note that this option can be combined with
\fB\-\-newer\fP to specify exact date ranges.
.IP "\fB\-\-ports=NUM1:NUM2\fP"
Use ports from the range NUM1-NUM2 for the data streams of TCP-based
transports (currently, bbcp, bbftp, fish-tcp, and gridftp).  All
connections originate from the client host so the given port range must
be allowed on the network path to the remote host and by the remote host
itself.
.IP "\fB\-R, \-r, \-\-recursive\fP"
Transfer directories recursively.  This option implies
\fB\-\-no\-dereference\fP.Note that any symbolic links pointing
to directories given on the command line will be followed during
recursive transfers (identical to the default behavior of cp).
.IP "\fB\-\-secure\fP"
Encrypt data during remote transfers and use secure ciphers and MACs
with SSH-based tranports.  Note that this option will, in most cases,
decrease performance as it eliminates some higher performance transports
and increases CPU utilization during SSH connections.
.IP "\fB\-\-sync\fP"
Synchronize files between the source and destination, similar to the
rsync command.  By default, files that have the same size and
modification time at the source and destination will not be transferred.
If the size or modification time of a file differs between the two, the
contents of the file will be compared via checksum and any portions that
differ will be transferred to the destination.  To skip the size and
modification time checks and always begin with the checksum stage, use
\fB\-I\fP or \fB\-\-ignore\-times\fP.  If \fB\-\-no\-verify\fP is
specified, integrity verification is not performed, which will increase
performance when there are many files at the source that are not at
the destination but will decrease performance when there are large files
that have only small changes between the source and destination.
Setting \fB\-\-retry\fP to zero with this option can be used to show
which files differ without making any changes.  Note that when syncing
directories, the destination should be specified as the parent of the
location where the source directory should be transferred to.  Also note
that this option cannot be used with \fB\-\-create\-tar\fP or
\fB\-\-extract\-tar\fB.
.IP "\fB\-\-user=USER\fP"
Set the user that will be used to access remote systems.
.IP "\fB\-\-wait\fP"
Block until the transfer completes and print a summary of the transfer.
This option implies \fB\-\-no\-mail\fP.  An exit value of 0 indicates
that the transfer has successfully completed while an exit value of 1
indicates that the transfer has failed or that the waiting process was
terminated prematurely.
./"################################################################
.SH "FEATURE DISABLEMENT
./"################################################################
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-check\fP"
Disable file existence and size checks at the end of the transfer.
This option was included for benchmarking and completeness purposes
and is not recommended for general use.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-cron\fP"
Do not attempt to recover from host/process failures via cron.  Note
that when such a failure occurs, the transfer will become stuck in the
"run" state until stopped.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-mail\fP"
Prevents sending of emails due to errors, warnings, or completion.
This option may be desirable when performing a large number of scripted
transfers.  Note that equivalent transfer status and history information
can always be manually retrieved using \fB\-\-status\fP and
\fB\-\-history\fP, respectively.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-offline\fP"
By default, files transferred to/from DMF-managed file systems will be
migrated to offline media as soon as the transfer completes.  This
option specifies that files should not be migrated.  Note that DMF may
still choose to migrate (and possibly release) files even when this
option is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-preserve\fP"
By default, times, permissions, ownership, ACLs, and extended attributes
of transferred files and directories are preserved when possible.
This option specifies that these items should not be preserved.  Note
that permissions may be left in various states depending on the invoking
user's umask and the transport utilized.  In particular, read access at
the destination may be more permissive than read access at the source.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-verify\fP"
By default, files are checksummed at the source and destination to
verify that they have not been corrupted and if corruption is detected,
the corrupted portion of the destination file is automatically corrected
using a partial transfer from the original source.  This functionality
decreases the performance of transfers in proportion to the file size.
If assurance of integrity is not required, the \fB\-\-no\-verify\fP
option may be used to disable verification.
./"################################################################
.SH "TRANSFER MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT
./"################################################################
Once one or more transfers have been initialized, the user may view
transfer history, stop/restart transfers, and/or check transfer status
with the following options.
.IP "\fB\-\-history\fP"
Show a brief history of all transfers including the transfer identifier,
the origin host/directory and the original command.
.IP "\fB\-\-id=NUM\fP"
Specify the transfer identifier to be used with management and status
commands.
.IP "\fB\-\-mgr=HOST\fP"
Set the host that will be used to manage transfers.  By default, this
host will be accessed as the current user with hostbased authentication
or an existing ssh agent.  The user and/or identity used to access the
manager host may be changed with the \fB\-\-mgr\-user\fP and
\fB\-\-mgr\-identity\fP options, respectively.
.IP "\fB\-\-mgr\-identity=FILE\fP"
Authenticate to the manager host using the given ssh identity file.
The corresponding public key must reside in the appropriate user's
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the manager host.  Note that only
identity files without passphrases are supported.  If a passphrase is
required, an ssh agent may be used instead, but with a loss of
reliability.  This option is not needed if the manager host accepts
hostbased authentication from client hosts.  
.IP "\fB\-\-mgr\-user=USER\fP"
Set the user that will be used to access the manager host.  Note that if
the transfer is initiated by root and \fB\-\-mgr\-identity\fP is not
specified, manager communication will be performed as the given user
so that user must be authorized to run processes locally.  In
particular, care should be taken on PBS-controlled nodes, where the
given user should either own the node or be on the user exception list.
.IP "\fB\-\-restart\fP"
Restart the transfer associated with the given \fB\-\-id\fP that was
stopped due to unrecoverable errors or stopped explicitly via
\fB\-\-stop\fP.  Note that transfers must be restarted on the original
client host or one that has equivalent file system access.  A subset of
the available command-line options may be respecified during a restart
including \fB\-\-bandwidth\fP, \fB\-\-buffer\fP, \fB\-\-clients\fP,
\fB\-\-cpu\fP, \fB\-\-disk\fP, \fB\-\-files\fP, \fB\-\-host-file\fP,

\fB\-\-streams\fP, \fB\-\-stripe\fP, \fB\-\-threads\fP, and \fB\-\-window\fP.
.IP "\fB\-\-search=REGEX\fP"
When \fB\-\-status\fP and \fB\-\-id\fP are specified, this option will
show the full status of file operations in the associated transfer whose
source or destination file name match the given regular expression.
.IP
When \fB\-\-history\fP is specified, this option will show a brief
history of the transfers whose origin host or original command match the
given regular expression.
.IP
Note that regular expressions must be given in Perl syntax (see
perlre(1) for details).
.IP "\fB\-\-state=STATE\fP"
When \fB\-\-status\fP and \fB\-\-id\fP are specified, this option will
show the full status of file operations in the associated transfer that
have the given state.  When \fB\-\-id\fP is not specified, this option
will show the brief status of transfers in the given state.  Valid
states are done, error, none, queue, run, and warn.  A state of "none"
will show a summary of the given transfer.
.IP "\fB\-\-stats\fP"
Show stats across all transfers including transfer counts, rates, tool
usage, initialization options, error counts, and error messages.
.IP "\fB\-\-status[={csv,pad}]\fP"
Show a brief status of all transfers including the transfer identifier,
the current state, the number of directories completed, the number of
files transferred, the number of files checksummed, the number of
attributes preserved, the amount of data transferred, the amount of data
checksummed, the time the transfer started, the duration of the
transfer, the estimated time remaining in the transfer, and the rate of
the transfer.  When the number of transfers exceeds a set threshold (20
by default), older successfully completed transfers beyond that limit
will be omitted for readability.  These omitted transfers can be shown
using \fB\-\-status\fP with \fB\-\-state=done\fP.  Status will be
returned in CSV format when \fB\-\-status=csv\fP is specified.  Duration
and estimated time will be zero-padded when \fB\-\-status=pad\fP is
specified.
.IP
When \fB\-\-id\fP is specified, this option will show the full status of
every file operation in the associated transfer.  For each operation,
this includes the state, the type, the tool used for processing, the
target path, associated information (error messages, checksums, byte
ranges, and/or running host) when applicable, the size of the file,
the time processing started, and the rate of the operation.  Note that
not all of these items will be applicable at all times (e.g. rate will
be empty if the state is error).  Also note that operations are
processed in batches so the rate shown for a single operation will
depend on the other operations processed in the same batch.
.IP "\fB\-\-stop\fP"
Stop the transfer associated with the given \fB\-\-id\fP.  Note that
transfer operations currently in progress will run to completion but new
operations will not be processed.  Stopped transfers may be restarted
with \fB\-\-restart\fP.

.SH "TRANSFER TUNING"
./"################################################################
Some advanced options are available to tune various aspects of shiftc
behavior.  These options are not needed by most users.
.IP "\fB\-\-bandwidth=BITS\fP"
Choose the TCP window size and number of TCP streams of TCP-based
transports (currently, bbcp, bbftp, fish-tcp, and gridftp) based on
the given bits per second.  The suffixes k, m, g, and t may be used for
Kb, Mb, Gb, and Tb, respectively.  The default bandwidth is estimated to
be 10 Gb/s if a 10 GE adapter is found on the client host, 1 Gb/s if the
client host can be resolved to an organization domain (by default, one
of the six original generic top-level domains), and 100 Mb/s otherwise.
.IP "\fB\-\-buffer=SIZE\fP"
Use memory buffer(s) of the given size when configurable in the
underlying tranport being utilized (currently, all but rsync).  The
suffixes k, m, g, and t may be used for KiB, MiB, GiB, and TiB,
respectively.  The default buffer size is 4 MiB.  Increasing the
buffer size trades higher memory utilization for more efficient I/O.
.IP "\fB\-\-files=COUNT\fP"
Process transfers in batches of the given number of files.  The
suffixes k, m, b or g, and t may be used for 1E3, 1E6, 1E9, and 1E12,
respectively.  The default batch count is 1000 files.  Lowering the
batch count will increase the number of checkpoints and the overhead of
transfer management.  Raising the batch count will have the opposite
effect.  A batch will be sent for processing when the number of files in
the batch reaches the given value.  Note that batches of less than the
given count can occur if the batch size specified by \fB\-\-size\fP is
reached first.
.IP "\fB\-\-local=LIST\fP"
Specify one or more local transports to be used for the transfer in
order of preference, separated by commas.  Valid transports for this
option currently include bbcp, bbftp, cp, fish, fish-tcp, gridftp,
mcp, and rsync.  Note that the given transport(s) will be given
priority, but may not be used in some cases (e.g. rsync is not capable
of transferring a specific portion of a file as needed by verification
mode).  In such cases, the default transport based on File::Copy will be
used.  The tool actually used for each file operation can be shown using
\fB\-\-status\fP with \fB\-\-id\fP set to the given transfer identifier.
.IP "\fB\-\-preallocate=NUM\fP"
Preallocate files when their sparsity is under the given percent, where
sparsity is defined as the number of bytes a file takes up on disk
divided by its size.  Note that this option will only have an effect
when the fallocate command is available, the destination file does not
already exist, and the target file system properly supports fallocate's
-n option.  Also note that this option will not function properly when
either bbftp or rsync (to a DMF file system) is utilized as the
transport due to their use of temporary files.
.IP "\fB\-\-remote=LIST\fP"
Specify one or more remote transports to be used for the transfer in
order of preference, separated by commas.  Valid transports for this
option currently include bbcp, bbftp, fish, fish-tcp, gridftp, rsync,
and sftp.  Note that the given transport(s) will be given priority, but
may not be used in some cases (e.g. bbftp is not capable of transferring
files with spaces in their names and is also incompatible with
\fB\-\-secure\fP).  In such cases, the default transport based on sftp
will be used.  The tool actually used for each file operation can be
shown using \fB\-\-status\fP with \fB\-\-id\fP set to the given transfer
identifier.
.IP "\fB\-\-retry=NUM\fP"
Retry operations deemed recoverable up to the given number of attempts
per file.  The default number of retries is 2.  A value of zero disables
retries.  Note that disabling retries also disables the ability of
\fB\-\-sync\fP to change file contents.  Also note that the given
value is cumulative across all stages of a file's processing so
different stages may not be retried the same number of times.
.IP "\fB\-\-size=SIZE\fP"
Process transfers in batches of approximately the given total file size.
The suffixes k, m, g, and t may be used for KB, MB, GB, and TB,
respectively.  The default batch size is 4 GB.  Lowering the batch size
will increase the number of checkpoints and the overhead of transfer
management.  Raising the batch size will have the opposite effect.  A
batch will be sent for processing when the total size of all files in
the batch reaches the given value.  Note that batches of less than the
given size can occur if the batch count specified by \fB\-\-files\fP
is reached first.
.IP "\fB\-\-split=SIZE\fP"
Parallelize the processing of single files using chunks of the given
size.  The suffixes k, m, g, and t may be used for KB, MB, GB, and TB,
respectively.  The default split size is zero, which disables single
file parallelization.  A split size of less than 1 GB is not
recommended.  Lowering the split size will increase parallelism but
decrease the performance of each file chunk and increase the overhead of
transfer management.  Raising the split size will have the opposite
effect.  The ideal split size for a given file is the size of the file
divided by the number of concurrent clients available.  Note that this
option does not have an effect unless \fB\-\-hosts\fP is greater than
one.  Also note that this option can, in some cases, decrease remote
transfer performance as it eliminates some higher performance
transports.
.IP "\fB\-\-split\-tar=SIZE\fP"
Create tar files of around the given size when used with
\fB\-\-create\-tar\fP.  When multiple tar files are created for a
destination tar file "file.tar", the resulting split tar files will be
named "file.tar-i.tar" starting from "file.tar-1.tar".  The suffixes k,
m, g, and t may be used for KB, MB, GB, and TB, respectively.  The
default split tar size is 500 GB.  A value of zero disables splitting.
A split tar size of greater than 2 TB is not recommended.  Note that
resulting tar files may still be larger than specified when source files
exist that are larger than the given size.
.IP "\fB\-\-streams=NUM\fP"
Use the given number of TCP streams in TCP-based transports (currently,
bbcp, bbftp, fish-tcp, and gridftp).  The default is the number of
streams necessary to fully utilize the specified/estimated bandwidth
using the maximum TCP window size.  Note that it is usually preferable
to specify \fB\-\-bandwidth\fP, which allows an appropriate number of
streams to be set automatically.  Increasing the number of streams can
increase performance when the maximum window size is set too low or
there is cross-traffic on the network, but too high a value can decrease
performance due to increased congestion and packet loss.
.IP "\fB\-\-stripe=SIZE|NUM\fP"
By default, a file transferred to a Lustre file system will be striped
according to size (one stripe per GB) unless the source resides on
Lustre and has non-default striping, in which case striping will be
preserved.  Directory striping is preserved when applicable.  If a
positive number is specified, the stripe count of all destination files
and directories will be set to the given value.  If the given value is a
size (specified with the suffixes k, m, g, and t for KB, MB, GB, and TB,
respectively), files will be allocated one stripe per given size while
directories will be striped according to the default policy.  A value of
zero disables automatic striping and uses the default policy for all
files and directories.
.IP "\fB\-\-threads=NUM\fP"
Use the given number of threads in multi-threaded transports and
checksum utilities (currently, mcp and msum).  The default number of
threads is 4.  Increasing the number of threads can increase
transfer/checksum performance when a host has excess resource capacity,
but can reduce performance when any associated resource has reached
its maximum.
.IP "\fB\-\-verify\-fast\fP"
Checksum files at the source and destination to verify that they have
not been corrupted.  If corruption is detected in a file, the corrupted
portion will be automatically corrected using a partial transfer.  This
option differs from the default verification in that the source buffer
will be reused when possible for the source checksum calculations.  This
potentially increases performance up to 33%, but is more subject to
corruption as the source is only read once.
.IP "\fB\-\-window=SIZE\fP"
Use a TCP send/receive window of the given size in TCP-based transports
(currently, bbcp, bbftp, fish-tcp, and gridftp).  The suffixes k, m,
g, and t may be used for KB, MB, GB, and TB, respectively.  The default
is the product of the specified/estimated bandwidth and the round-trip
time between source and destination.  Note that it is usually preferable
to specify \fB\-\-bandwidth\fP, which allows an appropriate window size
to be set automatically.  Increasing the window size allows TCP to
operate more efficiently over high bandwidth and/or high latency
networks, but too high a value can overrun the receiver and cause packet
loss.
./"################################################################
.SH "TRANSFER THROTTLING"
./"################################################################
.IP "\fB\-\-cpu=NUM\fP"
Throttle the transfer when the local CPU usage reaches the specified
percent of the total available.  This option is disabled by default but
may be desirable to prevent transfers from consuming too much of the
local CPU.  Once the given threshold is reached, a sleep period will
be induced between each batch of files to achieve an average CPU
utilization equal to the value specified.  Note that this functionality
is currently only supported on Unix-like systems.
.IP "\fB\-\-disk=NUM1:NUM2\fP"
Suspend/resume the transfer when the target file system disk usage
reaches the specified percent of the total available.  This option is
disabled by default but may be desirable to prevent transfers from
consuming too much local or remote disk space.  Once the first
threshold is reached, the transfer will suspend until enough disk
resources have been freed on the target to bring the disk utilization
under the second threshold.  Note that this functionality is currently
only supported on Unix-like systems.
.IP "\fB\-\-io=NUM\fP"
Throttle the transfer when the local I/O usage reaches the specified
rate in MB/s.  This option is disabled by default but may be desirable
to prevent transfers from consuming too much of the local I/O bandwidth.
Once the given threshold is reached, a sleep period will be induced
between each batch of files to achieve an average I/O rate equal to
the value specified.
.IP "\fB\-\-ior=NUM\fP"
Throttle the transfer when the local I/O reads reach the specified
rate in MB/s.  This option is similar to \fB\-\-io\fP but only applies
to reads.
.IP "\fB\-\-iow=NUM\fP"
Throttle the transfer when the local I/O writes reach the specified
rate in MB/s.  This option is similar to \fB\-\-io\fP but only applies
to writes.
.IP "\fB\-\-net=NUM\fP"
Throttle the transfer when the local network usage reaches the specified
rate in MB/s.  This option is disabled by default but may be desirable
to prevent transfers from consuming too much of the local network
bandwidth.  Once the given threshold is reached, a sleep period will be
induced between each batch of files to achieve an average network rate
equal to the value specified.
.IP "\fB\-\-netr=NUM\fP"
Throttle the transfer when the local network reads reach the specified
rate in MB/s.  This option is similar to \fB\-\-net\fP but only applies
to reads.
.IP "\fB\-\-netw=NUM\fP"
Throttle the transfer when the local network writes reach the specified
rate in MB/s.  This option is similar to \fB\-\-net\fP but only applies
